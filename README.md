If you don't want to get an `OPENAI_API_KEY`, you may also [use it with ChatGPT](#using-with-chatgpt).

Ready to try? The following command generates code for a Hello World app and displays it:

```sh
codespin gen --prompt 'Make a python program (in main.py) that prints Hello, World!'
```

To save the generated code to a file, use the `--write` (or `-w`) option:

```sh
codespin gen --prompt 'Make a python program (in main.py) that prints Hello, World!' --write
```

Simple, right? That's just the beginning.

### codespin init

Most features of codespin are available only once you initialize your project like this:

```sh
codespin init
```

This command creates a .codespin directory containing some default templates and configuration files.
You may edit these templates are required, but the default template is fairly good.

### codespin generate

Use the `codespin generate` command to produce source code.
You may also use the short alias `codespin gen`. The following examples will use `codespin gen`.

#### Generating a single code file

First, create a "prompt file" to describe the source code. A prompt file is simply a markdown file containing instructions on how to generate the code.

Let's start with something simple.

Create a file called `main.py.md` as follows:

```markdown
# specify the output file name

out: main.py

# which file contents to include in the prompt

## include: main.py

Print Hello, World!
Include a shebang to make it directly executable.
```

Then generate the code by calling codespin:

```sh
codespin gen main.py.md --write
```

Alternatively, you could specify the file paths in CLI with `--out` (or `-o` shorthand) and `--include` (or `-o`) instead of using front-matter.

```sh
codespin gen main.py.md --out main.py --include main.py --write
```

#### Generating multiple files

This is just as simple. Here's an example of how you'd scaffold a new Node.JS blog app:

`blogapp.md`:

```
Create a Node.JS application for a blog.
Split the code into multiple files for maintainability.
Use ExpressJS. Use Postgres for the database.
Place database code in a different file (a database layer).
```

#### Include External Files and Declarations

For the code generator to better understand the context, you must pass the relevant external files (such as dependencies) with the `--include` (or `-i`) option.

For example, if `main.py` depends on `dep1.py` and `dep2.py`:

```sh
codespin gen main.py.md --out main.py --include main.py --include dep1.py --include dep2.py --write
```

But in some cases, including entire files (with `--include` or `-i`) will result in larger context sizes. To reduce the size of the context, you can send just the declarations/signatures found in a file with the `--declare` (or `-d`) option.

```sh
codespin gen main.py.md --out main.py --include main.py -d dep1.py -d dep2.py --write
```

Note that creating declarations will require a call to the LLM. Declarations are then cached until the file changes.

With both `--include` and `--declare`, you can specify wildcards. The following will include all ".py" files:

```sh
codespin gen main.py.md --out main.py -d "*.py" --write
```

You can also define the `--include`, `--declare`, `--template`, `--parser`, `--api`, `--model`, and `--max-tokens` parameters in front-matter like this:

```markdown
---
model: gpt-3.5-turbo-16k
maxTokens: 8000
out: main.py
include:
  - dep1.py
  - dep2.py
---

Generate a Python CLI script named index.py that accepts arguments, called the calculate() function in dep1.py and prints their sum with print() in dep2.py.
```

#### In-place Includes in Prompt Files

It's quite a common requirement to mention a standard set of rules in all prompt files; such as mentioning coding convetions for a project. The include directive (`codespin:include:<path>`) let's you write common rules in a file, and include them in prompts as needed.

For example, if you had a `./codegen/conventions.txt` file:

```
- Use snake_case for variables
- Generate extensive comments
```

You can include it like this:

```
Generate a Python CLI script named index.py that accepts arguments and prints their sum.

codespin:include:codegen/conventions.txt
```

#### Executing code in Prompt Files

The exec directive executes a command and replaces the line with the output of the command.
This powerful techique can be used to make your templates smarter.

For example, if you want to include the diff of a file in your prompt, you could do this:

```
codespin:exec:git diff HEAD~1 HEAD -- main.py
```

#### Regenerating code

The easiest way to regenerate code (for a single file) is by changing the original prompt to mention just the required modifications.

For example, if you originally had this in `calculate_area.py.md`:

```markdown
Write a function named calculate_area(l, b) which returns l\*b.
```

You could rewrite it as:

```markdown
Change the function calculate_area to take an additional parameter shape_type (as the first param), and return the correct caculations. The subsequent parameters are dimensions of the shape, and there could be one (for a circle) or more dimensions (for a multi-sided shape).
```

And run the gen command as usual:

```sh
codespin gen calculate_area.py.md --out calculate_area.py --include calculate_area.py -w
```

Sometimes you want to ignore the latest modifications while generating code, and use previously committed file contents.
The include parameter (both as a CLI arg and in frontmatter) understands git revisions.

You can do that by specifying the version like this.

```sh
codespin gen calculate_area.py.md --out calculate_area.py --include HEAD:calculate_area.py -w
```

You can include diffs as well:

```sh
# Diff a file between two versions
codespin gen main.py.md --out main.py --include HEAD~2+HEAD:main.py -w
```

There are some convenient shortcuts.

```sh
# include HEAD:main.py
codespin gen main.py.md --out main.py --include :main.py -w

# diff between HEAD and Working Copy
codespin gen main.py.md --out main.py --include +:main.py -w

# diff between HEAD~2 and Working Copy
codespin gen main.py.md --out main.py --include HEAD~2+:main.py -w
```

This command above will ignore the latest edits to main.py and use content from git's HEAD.

#### Options for codespin gen

- `-o, --out <output file path>`: Name of the file to generate (optional)
- `-p, --prompt <some text>`: Specify the prompt directly in the command line.
- `-t, --template <template path>`: Specify the template. If not provided, a default template is used.
- `-w, --write`: Save the generated code to a file. Defaults to 'false'.
- `--pp, --print-prompt`: Display the generated prompt without making an API call.
- `--write-prompt`: Save the generated prompt to a specified path without making an API call.
- `--api <api name>`: Specify the API service, like 'openai'. Defaults to 'openai'.
- `--model <model name>`: Specify the desired model, e.g., 'gpt-4'.
- `--max-tokens <count>`: Set the maximum tokens for the generated code.
- `-i, --include <file path>`: Specify files to include in the prompt for better context. Repeat for multiple files.
- `-e, --exec <script path>`: Execute a command for each generated file, e.g., to run a formatting tool.
- `--debug`: Enable debug mode, showing debug messages for each step.
- `-c, --config <file path>`: Specify the path to a config file.
- `--base-dir <dir path>`: Set the directory path relative to where files are generated. Defaults to the current directory.
- `--parser <path to js file>`: Use this parser to process LLM results
- `--no-parse`: Do not parse llm results. Print it as received.
- `--head`: Use content from git's HEAD rather than the working copy
- `-h, --help`: Display help.

## Inline Prompting

As shown earlier, you can specify the prompt directly in the command line:

```sh
codespin gen --prompt 'Create a file main.py with a function to add two numbers.'
```

Remember to use `--write` to save the generated files.

## Custom Templates

A CodeSpin Template is a JS file (an ES6 Module) exporting a default function with the following signature:

```ts
// The templating function that generates the LLM prompt.
export default function generate(args: TemplateArgs): string {
  // Return the prompt to send to the LLM.
}
```

where TemplateArgs is the following:

```ts
// Arguments to the templating function
export type TemplateArgs = {
  prompt: string;
  promptWithLineNumbers: string;
  include: VersionedFileInfo[];
  declare: BasicFileInfo[];
  outPath: string | undefined;
  promptSettings: unknown;
  templateArgs: string[] | undefined;
  workingDir: string;
};

export type BasicFileInfo = {
  path: string;
  contents: string;
};

export type VersionedFileInfo =
  | {
      path: string;
      type: "contents";
      contents: string;
      version: string;
    }
  | {
      path: string;
      type: "diff";
      diff: string;
      version1: string | undefined;
      version2: string | undefined;
    };
```

When generating code, specify custom templates with the `--template` (or `-t`) option:

```sh
codespin gen main.py.md --out main.py --template mypythontemplate.mjs --include main.py -w
```

ðŸ’¡: Your template should the extension `mjs` instead of `js`.

Once you do `codespin init`, you should be able to see example templates under the "codespin/templates" directory.

There are two ways to pass custom args to a custom template.

1. frontMatter in a prompt file goes under args.promptSettings

```markdown
---
model: gpt-3.5-turbo-16k
maxTokens: 8000
useJDK: true //custom arg
out: main.py
---
```

2. CLI args can be passed to the template with the `-a` (or `--template-args`), and they'll be available in args.templateArgs as a string array.

```sh
codespin gen main.py.md \
  --template mypythontemplate.mjs \
  -a useAWS \
  -a swagger \
  --out main.py \
  --include main.py \
  --write
```

## Using with ChatGPT

While using codespin with an API key is straightforward, if you don't have one but have access to ChatGPT, there are alternatives.

Use the `--pp` (or `--print-prompt`) option to display the final LLM prompt, or `--write-prompt` to save it to a file:

```sh
# Display on screen
codespin gen something.py.md --print-prompt

# Or save to a file
codespin gen something.py.md --write-prompt /path/to/file.txt
```

Copy and paste the prompt into ChatGPT. Save ChatGPT's response in a file, e.g., `gptresponse.txt`.

Then, use the `codespin parse` command to parse the content:

```sh
# As always, use --write for writing to the disk
codespin parse gptresponse.txt --write
```

ðŸ’¡: When copying the response from ChatGPT, use the copy icon. Selecting text and copying doesn't retain formatting.

## One more thing - Piping into the LLM!

Well, prompts can include data that was piped into `codespin gen` as well. :)

In your prompt, `codespin:stdin` will refer to whatever was passed to codespin.

For example, let's pipe the output of the `ls` command into codespin:

```sh
ls | codespin gen -p $'Convert to uppercase each line in the following text \ncodespin:stdin' -t plain.mjs --no-parse
```

The above example uses the included `plain.mjs` template along with the `--no-parse` option to print the LLM's response directly to the console.
This is so handy there's shorthand for this: the `-g` option (g for Go).

```sh
# This
ls | codespin gen -p $'Convert to uppercase each line in the following text \ncodespin:stdin' -t plain.mjs --no-parse

# can be written as
ls | codespin gen -p $'Convert to uppercase each line in the following text \ncodespin:stdin' -g
```
